It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).

```hcl
module "ecs_service_alarms" {
  source         = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.git?ref=master"
  namespace      = "eg"
  stage          = "staging"
  name           = "app"
  cluster_name   = "example"
  service_name   = "app"
}
```
